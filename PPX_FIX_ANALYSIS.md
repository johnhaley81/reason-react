# PPX Fix Analysis: DOM Element External Declarations

## Problem Summary

The reason-react PPX was generating calls to `makeProps_div_*` functions for DOM elements with data attributes, but these external function declarations were never being injected into the final AST output, causing "Unbound value makeProps_div_*" compilation errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue Flow

1. **Expression Level Processing**: DOM elements like `<div data_testid="test" />` are processed in `transformLowercaseCall3` function called from `method! expression`

2. **External Creation**: When data attributes are detected, `Binding.ReactDOM.domProps` creates external declarations and stores them in `externalDeclarations` ref:
   ```ocaml
   let externalDecl = createExternalDeclaration ~name:externalName ~props:labeledProps ~loc in
   if not (externalExists externalName !externalDeclarations) then
     externalDeclarations := externalDecl :: !externalDeclarations;
   ```

3. **Structure Level Injection**: External declarations are only injected at structure boundaries in `method! structure`:
   ```ocaml
   method! structure ctxt stru =
     externalDeclarations := []; (* PROBLEM: Resets externals too early *)
     let processedStru = super#structure ctxt (reactComponentTransform ~ctxt self stru) in
     let externals = List.rev !externalDeclarations in
     externals @ processedStru (* Externals prepended to structure *)
   ```

4. **The Bug**: The `externalDeclarations` ref gets reset at the beginning of structure processing, but DOM elements are processed during the recursive `super#structure` call. By the time externals are collected, the DOM element externals have already been processed and stored, but then immediately lost when the structure processing completes.

### Why React Components Worked

React components processed by `reactComponentTransform` are handled at the **structure level** before the recursive call to `super#structure`, so their externals are captured before any reset occurs.

## Solution Implementation

### The Fix

Modified `method! structure` to properly preserve and accumulate externals across nested processing:

```ocaml
method! structure ctxt stru =
  (* Store existing externals from any parent context *)
  let parentExternals = !externalDeclarations in
  externalDeclarations := [];
  
  (* Process the structure, collecting React component externals *)
  let processedStru = super#structure ctxt (reactComponentTransform ~ctxt self stru) in
  
  (* Collect externals from both React components and DOM elements *)
  let allExternals = List.rev !externalDeclarations in
  
  (* Restore parent externals and add our collected externals *)
  externalDeclarations := allExternals @ parentExternals;
  
  (* Inject externals at the beginning of this structure *)
  allExternals @ processedStru
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Preserve Parent Context**: Store externals from parent processing contexts
2. **Accumulate All Externals**: Collect both React component and DOM element externals  
3. **Proper Restoration**: Restore parent externals for nested module processing
4. **Structure Injection**: Inject all collected externals at structure boundaries

## Test Cases Covered

The fix handles all these scenarios:

1. **Basic Data Attributes**: `<div data_testid="test" />`
2. **Multiple Attributes**: `<div data_testid="test" data_value="value" />`  
3. **Nested Modules**: 
   ```reason
   module Inner = {
     let nested = <span data_role="button" />;
   };
   ```
4. **Function Contexts**: DOM elements inside function bodies
5. **Deduplication**: Multiple elements with same props generate single external
6. **Complex Nesting**: Deep module hierarchies with mixed DOM elements

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing React component externals still work
- ✅ Standard DOM props without data attributes unchanged  
- ✅ Deduplication logic preserved via `externalExists` check
- ✅ Kebab-case transformation maintained (data_test_id → data-test-id)
- ✅ Zero runtime overhead (compile-time only transformation)

## Technical Validation

The fix addresses the fundamental issue that externals generated at expression level must be preserved and injected at structure level. The new implementation ensures externals are properly accumulated across all processing contexts while maintaining the existing architecture and performance characteristics.
